{"prompt": "What are the instructions for preparing green onion garlic naan bread, an Indian bread, with a total time of about 38 minutes, and an estimated calorie content of 282 per serving?", "completion": "Dish Title: Green Onion Garlic Naan Bread\nCuisine: Indian\nTimings: Prep Time: 20 mins, Cook Time: 3 mins, Total Time: 38 mins, Servings: 6\nIngredients:\n  Ingredients:\n    1 \u00bd cups bread flour, plus more as needed\n    \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt\n    2 teaspoons baking powder\n    1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n    4 cloves garlic, crushed\n    \u00bd cup thinly sliced green onions\n    2 tablespoons melted butter\nDirections:\n  Step 1: Place bread flour in a bowl. Add salt and baking powder and give it a good whisk until evenly combined.\n  Step 2: Add in Greek yogurt gently, followed by garlic and green onions. Take a wooden spoon and slowly start mixing everything together. Keep mixing, stirring, and pressing until a shaggy dough forms.\n  Step 3: Transfer dough to a work surface and use your hands to press dough together. Knead for a few minutes until dough becomes elastic and a little bit sticky. Add a bit more flour as necessary but try to keep extra flour at an absolute minimum. Knead until dough is a little bit stretchy, 3 to 5 minutes.\n  Step 4: Wrap in plastic and allow to rest on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes.\n  Step 5: Take a bench scraper and cut into 6 equal pieces. Take 1 portion and roll into a ball. Place onto a generously floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll out nice and thin, about 1/8 inch or less. It's ok if the naan is not a perfect circle. You will need extra flour for rolling out as the dough is sticky, but try to use as little as possible.\n  Step 6: Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Transfer dough circles into the hot dry skillet and cook until little bubbles form on the surface and the underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Flip naan over and cook for 1 more minute. Press down slightly with a spatula to increase the heat during cooking. Flip over twice more and cook for an additional 15 seconds per side, but make sure not to overcook to preserve the texture. Naan should still be flexible when you remove it from the skillet onto a plate.\n  Step 7: Cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm and moist while you cook the other naan breads. Stack all 6 naan breads on top of each other and keep covered with a kitchen towel.\n  Step 8: When you are finished cooking all 6 naan breads, unstack breads and brush the first naan bread on both sides with a little bit of melted butter. Stack second piece of naan on top and only brush the top side. Keep stacking and buttering all the naan breads. Fold each naan into a triangle and serve.\nNutrition Facts:\n  Calories: 282, Fat: 5g, Carbs: 53g, Protein: 10g\n"}

Spread one side with mustard. Place bacon strips on the mustard and sprinkle with paprika. Arrange onion slices cross-wise on the beef. Then evenly space 3 pickle slices across each slice of beef. Keep about an inch of the narrowest end of the beef slice free of toppings to facilitate rolling it up.\n  Step 2: Roll each slice of meat, beginning from the wider of the two short ends, working to keep all ingredients inside the roll. Rolls should be nice and tight. Secure the rolls (seam side down) with 3 loops of butcher's twine, one in the middle and one at each end. Trim excess string.\n  Step 3: Heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. Cook beef, turning and browning well on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove meat from pan.

Raise heat to medium-high and simmer until sauce begins to thicken, about 1 minute.\n  Step 4: Transfer beef rolls to pan along with accumulated juices. Reduce heat to very low. Simmer gently, covered, turning rolls every 20 minutes or so, until beef is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. When the tip of a sharp knife can easily be inserted into the beef roll, the meat is done.\n  Step 5: Transfer meat to dish to allow it to rest.
